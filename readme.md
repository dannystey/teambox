# Teambox

provides an overview of your teambox entries.

## Install / Register / Usage

1. Install the script globally (if you dont have administration permissions you should use it with `sudo`)
    `npm install teambox -g`
2. Register the teambox with `teambox register <DOMAIN> <MAID> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> [force]`
    - the force argument is optional and overwrites the current configuration

3. Just call `teambox` and you get an summary of your current booked items.
